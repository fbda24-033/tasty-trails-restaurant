      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Chef Amanda Dlamini, a passionate cook who aimed to unite people through delectable and cozy meals, opened Tasty Trails Restaurant in 2012. Her passion to showcase both traditional and modern foods led to the growth of what began as a tiny restaurant with 10 seats. Tasty Trails, which prioritizes quality and culture, soon gained popularity among locals seeking filling meals and friendly service.

      <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
      <p>
        Tasty Trails has recovered more robustly thanks to tenacity and the encouragement of our devoted clientele. We have grown into a full-service restaurant with two more locations, a new kitchen update, and a staff of fifteen. In addition to stabilizing, our revenue has increased by 25% over our pre-pandemic performance. In order to reach even more people with our meals, we are now also providing catering and online ordering.
